# Python-Excercises

1. Write a Python function that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them in reverse order with a space between them.
   Example if first name is `Barack` and last name is `Obama`
   ```
   Obama Barack
   ```
2. Write a Python function that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius entered by the user.
    Sample Output :
    ```
    r = 1.1
    Area = 3.8013271108436504
    ```

3. Write a Python function to display the first and last colors from the following list.
   color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
   Output should be
   ```
   Red Black
   ```
4. Write a Python function that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
   ```
   Sample value of n is 5
   Expected Result : 615
   ```
5. Write a Python function to get the volume of a sphere with any radius.
   ```
    r = 6
    Volume = 904.78
   ```
6. Write a Python function to get n (non-negative integer) copies of the first 2 characters of a given string. Return n copies of the whole string if the length is less than 2.
   ```
   str = emmanuel
   Result: em
   ```
   ```
   str = e
   Result: e
   ```
7. Write a Python function to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not.
   ```
   input: i
   output: yes
   ```
8. Write a Python function to sum two given integers. However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20.
   ```
    input:
     4
     5
     6
   output: 20
   ```
   ```
    input:
